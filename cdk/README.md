# Welcome to your CDK project!

This section contains all the CDK code written in Typescript to create
CloudWatch resources. The CDK template will create CloudWatch metrics,
alarms, and a dashboard to display the current measurements collected by
the peripherals.

## Configure Plant Demo

### CDK configuration

To configure the plant demo, edit the `config-params.ts` file with the
calibrated values for your device peripherals. To receive notifications
when the plant is in the alarm state add your email to the email field.
The AWS IoT Core Endpoint can be found in the AWS IoT console. In the
navigation pane, choose **Settings**. Under **Device data endpoint**
select the **Endpoint** to make a copy of the endpoint for your account.
This endpoint will need to be added to `cdk/config-params.ts` and
`arduino/plant_reference.h`. In order to get the **ThingName**, flash
the host board with the code in the **Arduino** folder with the
`expresslink_init()` call.

### AWS account

Within your AWS account navigate to the **IAM Identity Center** and click
Enable in the **Enable IAM Identity Center** box. On the left navigate to
User and click **Add User**. Follow the steps to set the username, email,
password, and name for the user. There is no need to add the user to a
group. You may need to wait a few minutes to receive an email to set up
the password for the user.

## Running Plant Demo

To run the plant example, execute the following:

```bash
npm install -g aws-cdk;
cd cdk;
npm install;
cdk bootstrap;
cdk deploy;
```

Then, to dispose of the stack/s afterwards

```bash
cdk destroy
```

## Useful CDK commands

* `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
* `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
* `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
* `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation

## [Accessing the Grafana Workspace](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/grafana/latest/userguide/AMG-working-with-Grafana-workspace.html)

After deploying the CDK template navigate to **Amazon Grafana** in your
AWS account. Click on **All Workspaces** in the menu on the left side to
find the Grafana Workspace that was created. Within the **Authentication**
section, add the user that was created in the
**IAM Identity Center configuration**. After doing this you should be able
to login as this user to the grafana workspace.

To find the dashboard in the Grafana Workspace, click on **General/Home**
in the upper left corner. From there you should find the dashboard listed.
